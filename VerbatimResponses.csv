Pushing other companies to be better champions of humanity while excelling in their business ventures. Love the message. Love knowing that even if my company doesn't have a supportive environment, I can still be a personal ally just so any person that works with me, will feel the right form of ""I will always find you."" Thank you for your time and efforts globally!!!"

One or two were unfocused on the topics, they seemed to wander somewhere else, one on Blob Storage spent a long time talking about OneDrive and Sharepoint but not in terms of Blob. It might be better to try and group like topics closer together, for example one set of rooms where developer topics were mostly held. I did not go to a couple of talks as they were so far away from the previous. "

259807,-7900267992628119157,Please provide any additional comments.,For some reason the 2017 session landed with me better than this year. I don't feel like I got a focused presentation from the product teams...I know MS Teams had to have a separate session at 4pm. It was tricky to follow the track. Also wish the D&T session would have been at a different time. I wanted to be in two places at once.

Very frustrating. Felt like there was far more time spent ‘marketing’ new products than providing technical deep dives and help for products that have existed, and will continue to exist, for years to come."

I don't know why everyone sits on the ends and expects everyone to climb past them.  Not Microsoft's fault, but it would help people if you could put it out as a public service announcement."

Thanks for listening to our woes!  Could you consider doing the same for W10 Pro, please?    Also, thank you for the tools you have provided to assess failed upgrades.  These things all make my job easier.    As for logistics, I certainly noticed that the timing and location of sessions improved dramatically.  A lot less walking and worrying about how short the gap is between sessions.    Meals overall were delicious, and I could tell Microsoft did indeed listen to feedback and plan accordingly.  Outstanding conference - best one yet!  Good on you, Microsoft!"

Popular speakers I believe are well known now that they should be put into larger rooms. Sami Laiho has been filling up rooms for the last 3 years Ive been at ignite but he still seems to be in smaller rooms leaving a lot of people missing his session. Otherwise the location(s) are perfect. Bag was great, keep that up. The expo and additional common areas all being in the area they where this year was the best. "

If a vendor wanted me to know something for that day, or the next, why couldn't they send it directly to me via the App? I already gave them permissions to contact me. Just be sure to filter Ignite specific notifications from Vendor notifications."

The speakers were very clear and engaging, also spoke at a pace where I was able to absorb the information. I loved that they provided a QR code for the link to the slides before the presentation so I didn’t have to take many notes and was able to listen to what they had to say.

I felt the Keynote was just customer success stories but should have been informational teasers of what's to come.  Get everyone excited about the new products and features.  That's why we were there.  Instead of leaving with a general feeling of excitement I felt it could have been time better spent.  The second point was the overlap.  Even though the sessions were different, the demo ended up being almost identical in many cases. "

259807,-5744189580658463625,"Please provide additional constructive comments, suggestions, or feedback to improve your experience.","Keynote was disappointing - felt like the Envision keynote was presented at Ignite, only vision talk, no new announcements.     Overall the content presented was great, glad to hear about the security updates in Office 365.    This time it was definitely an improvement in managing people - most of the sessions were at one side of the conference center, hence less walking, which was great!     Thanks for providing awesome hot lunch/food this time! Much appreciated! There was a good variety of food options too. Toasters and Bagels were a great touch.    Negative Feedback:  1) This year the quality of Microsoft giveaways went down, there were cool giveaways this year at all, last two years had better quality of cool products such as Bluetooth speakers etc.    2) Having the Microsoft Store on the floor was certainly a good idea but there was no discount on the products, if you can't give discounts day one (which is most of the population gets one-day passes), you could give discounts on the last day, incentive for those who have booked the conference pass.
